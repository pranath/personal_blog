The Third Attractor is a concept developed by <a href="https://civilizationemerging.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Schmachtenberger</a> with regard to the development of our species and civilisation. This idea was explored as a series of two podcast episodes hosted by <a href="https://rebelwisdom.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rebel Wisdom</a>.

Synopsis

>Where are we headed as a species? What is the landscape of risks and challenges that we need to confront over the next decades, and are there a small number of key factors that we need to solve to avoid catastrophe? 
>
>These are the questions Daniel Schmachtenberger is laying out in a new two part series on Rebel Wisdom, called 'In Search of the Third Attractor'. 
>
>As he describes it, the power of ever increasing technological capacity (exponential tech) means that both destructive and creative capacities are increasing exponentially. Two of the most likely outcomes (attractors) are either some kind of chaotic breakdown, or the development of powerful control systems in response, oppressive authoritarian control. 
>
>Given this, what does a third option, a 'third attractor' look like?
