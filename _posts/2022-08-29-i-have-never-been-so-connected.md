Mobile technology and social media has enabled us to communicate and connect with others over great distances and time in a way that can seem very flexible and convenient for our modern busy lives.

Indeed the [positive impacts](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mobile-technology-the-amazing-impact-on-our-lives/) could be seen as significant and empowering, including enabling us to to access more information, to deliver goods and services to us, enabling us to connect with others with shared interests far away that we may never have met in real life, and discover and debate with those with different views just as easily. It can give a direct voice to those who have previously had no voice.

An yet equally, mobile technology inevitably [effects our behaviour in the real world, with others in our proximity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-your-cell-phone-hurts-your-relationships/). 
These online means of human connection often lack the full range of human expression such as tone of voice, body language and physical expression. This can lead to text messages easily being mis-interpreted for example. 

Many children have now only experienced a mobile only world, where online connections are as normal as in person ones. These technologies have combined with others such as machine learning and AI, to create mobile experiences that are optimised to be as engaging and addictive as possible. It is arguable to what extent we are able to make free choices as to how much we use these devices, [often at the expense](https://theconversation.com/how-our-phones-disconnect-us-when-were-together-130838) of connecting with those in our physical proximity.

Does these mean humans are losing the ability to connect with each other? Or is our idea of connection simply undergoing a radical transformation? And if so, are we choosing this transformation or not? 

What would the world of the future be like where we use these devices increasingly to connect with each other? How might this effect the development of our society and species?
